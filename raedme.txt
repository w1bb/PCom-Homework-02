-----------------------------

    My homework implements a simple C++ application which allows UDP clients to
connect to a server that acts like a broker, communicating with TCP subscribers.
    The implementation is written in modern C++ (C++ 17) and contains some
useful extra features, such as logging capabilities and gracefully quiting when
Ctrl+C is pressed (SIGINT).


File structure
==============

    The files are organized as presented bellow (in alphabetical order):

    > Makefile
        : A complete makefile, containing all the necessary building rules, as
        : well as testing and cleaning rules.
    > readme.txt
        : This file, a tour of the project.
    > server.cpp
        : This is the TCP/UDP server that shall act as a broker.
    > structs.hpp + struct.cpp
        : These files contain the structures that will be used to send messages
        : back and forth.
    > subscriber.cpp
        : This is the TCP client (subscriber) that shall receive the data
        : provided by the other UDP clients.
    > utils.hpp + utils.cpp
        : These files contain the logging implementation and a simple way to
        : break a string into commands.

Special features
================

    As it was previously stated, some additional features were implemented as
well, including (but not limited to):

    > Logging capabilities
        : This allows for quick and easy development. In order to turn this
        : feature ON, please modify the Makefile by uncommenting the
        : -DLOG_ENABLE flag.
    > Ctrl+C (SIGINT) guard
        : This features disables the default behaviour of SIGINT so that it
        : can gracefully disconnect all the clients and close down the server.
    > Input sanitization
        : The user should not be able to break the server when communicating
        : with it.
